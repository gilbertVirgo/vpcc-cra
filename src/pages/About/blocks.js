				<p>
					In 2010, captivated by a vision for bringing the gospel to
					Tower Hamlets, Ben Virgo and a small nucleus of family and
					friends began to meet on Sundays.
				</p>
				<p>
					For about a decade, the church plant met in Ben and Rachel’s
					family home. One week, the kitchen was so full that there
					was only standing room. That week, in God’s sovereign
					kindness, a door was opened to meet in a local hall.
				</p>
				<p>
					Today, VPCC meets a stone’s throw away from Victoria Park—a
					small but vibrant community of believers who have a shared
					priority of encouraging one another in the gospel of Jesus
					Christ.
