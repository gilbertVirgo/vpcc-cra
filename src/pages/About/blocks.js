					Victoria Park Community Church began in 2011, when friends
					and family gathered in Pastor Ben’s living room with a
					shared vision: to enjoy and share the hope of the gospel in
					Tower Hamlets — a diverse area where few know Christ.
				</p>

				<p>
					From the start, prayer shaped our life together, and God
					answered: a neighbour overcame depression, a lonely student
					found belonging, and others discovered genuine friendship.
				</p>

				<p>
					As we grew, the local Tenants and Residents Association
					offered us their community centre just when we needed more
					space.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now we meet at Victoria Park Baptist Church, welcoming
					people from near and far, united by the gospel, building
					deep relationships, and reaching out with love to our wider
					community.

					Victoria Park Community Church began in 2011, when a group
					of friends and family gathered in Pastor Ben’s living room
					with a shared vision: to enjoy the hope of the gospel and
					share it in Tower Hamlets — a place rich in diversity but
					where few know Christ.
				</p>
				<p>
					From the outset, prayer shaped our life together, and God
					answered in remarkable ways: a neighbour came through
					depression, a student without friends found belonging, and
					others discovered the welcome of genuine friendship.
				</p>
				<p>
					As our numbers grew, so did the opportunities. The very week
					we needed more room, the local Tenants and Residents
					Association offered us their community centre.
				</p>
				<p>
					Today we meet at Victoria Park Baptist Church, with people
					coming from both nearby and further afield, united by the
					same heartbeat: the gospel at the centre, blessed to be a
					blessing, building deep relationships, and reaching out with
					love to our wider community.
